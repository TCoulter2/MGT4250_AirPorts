 - Our question is “When are the busiest and least busiest times to travel on the top three airlines in the top 10 major domestic airports?”
 - This is an important question because it is crucial for customers to understand when it may be more challenging to get a seat on a flight or for different airlines and airports to know when they may need to hire more temporary workers to handle the increased demand for people taking flights.
  - To understand which months to quantify as “busy times'' and “least busiest times” we collected information from a USA Today [article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2017/02/28/busiest-times-of-year-to-fly/98484452/#:~:text=Answer%3A%20There%20are%20several%20times%20a%20year%20when,holiday%20season%2C%20from%20mid-December%20into%20the%20new%20year.), as well as an AFAR [article](https://www.afar.com/magazine/tsa-just-had-its-busiest-week-ever#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20TSA%2C%20the%20busiest%20travel%20days,nearly%202.9%20million%20passengers%20passed%20through%20TSA%20checkpoints.).
  - Understanding this will allow us to further analyze our data and understand different trends within our data.
  - Our analysis focuses on the top three airlines; American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines.
  - Our analysis also focuses on the top 10 major domestic airports:
     1. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International
     2. Denver International
     3. Dallas/Fort Worth International
     4. Chicago O’Hare International
     5. Los Angeles International
     6. Harry Reid International
     7. Orlando International
     8. Charlotte Douglas International
     9. Phoenix Sky Harbor International
     10. Seattle/Tacoma International

- Our data used in our analysis was retrieved from [The Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/topics/airlines-and-airports/quick-links-popular-air-carrier-statistics), includes passenger and flight data from the top three airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines, and is filtered to include the top 10 major domestic airports:
     1. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International
     2. Denver International
     3. Dallas/Fort Worth International
     4. Chicago O’Hare International
     5. Los Angeles International
     6. Harry Reid International
     7. Orlando International
     8. Charlotte Douglas International
     9. Phoenix Sky Harbor International
     10. Seattle/Tacoma International
- We gathered data from the "Flights" section and filtered the data set based on the above criteria. After downloading the data sets for each airline and for each airport, we then uploaded our data into an Excel spreadsheet, ensuring there are no errors in the data and combined all the data sets we retrieved.

## Section 3:
 [In your README file] For each visualization, 
 • Great (1 point): Interpret a visualization and explain how it contributes to answering 
your question. 

The first dashboard includes two visualizations that creates a foundation for answering our underlying question: When are the busiest and least busiest times to travel on the top three airlines in the top 10 major domestic airports? “Top 10 Airports in Terms of Number of Flights”, is a visualization map that compares the ten most trafficked domestic airports. The graph is marked with ten circles, with each dot representing one airport, that vary in size corresponding to their ranking in popularity. For example, Atlanta is the most trafficked airport in the country and thus has the biggest plot on the graph. This visualization allows the reader to better picture where the ten most popular airports are on a map and provides a good idea of how popular each airport is. “Flights Per Month by Airport” also tracks the top ten most popular domestic airports, but compares them by total flights in thousands to a given month. This graph goes one step further than the visualization map. By analyzing each airport by month, we can start to determine when the busiest and least busiest time is to travel. Generally, February and September are the least busy months and you should avoid traveling in November. The graphs indicate that the top three airports in the United States are located in Atlanta, Dallas, and Denver.

The next dashboard includes two visualizations that compare the top three airlines in the United States by month. “Flights Per Month by Airline” measures the amount of flights per month by airline, in thousands, to a given month. “Passengers Per Month By Airline” similarly compares the top three domestic airlines by month but instead of total flights, the graph depicts total passengers by millions. Across the board, airlines in order from most to least popular, include: American Airlines, Delta Airlines, and United Airlines. By targeting specific airline traffic instead of airports, these visualizations contribute to answering our research question and allow for a more direct answer to when the busiest and least busy times are for travel. If someone is looking to travel with the least amount of people, but still wants to travel with a premier airline, the individual should fly in February but specifically with United Airlines. We can most likely infer that February is the best time to travel because it is after the holiday season. Individuals and families are less inclined to fly because the chance of them flying to see family and friends is increased around this time. It would be in someone's best interest to avoid travel in June, as the passengers per month is universally much higher during this time of year. This increase in travel can be attributed to academic and work related summer vacations.

 o Find an article related to your questions and summarize the article. 
 o Ask your questions to generative AI. Include generative AI’s response with your query (Ask as many as possible for proper responses; Mention that the response is generated from which generative AI. For example, ChatGPT) 
 o Discuss whether your visualizations align well with the article and generative AI’s response.
