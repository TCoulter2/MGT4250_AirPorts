 - Our question is “When are the busiest and least busiest times to travel on the top three airlines in the top 10 major domestic airports?”
 - This is an important question because it is crucial for customers to understand when it may be more challenging to get a seat on a flight or for different airlines and airports to know when they may need to hire more temporary workers to handle the increased demand for people taking flights.
 - Our data, retrieved from [The Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/topics/airlines-and-airports/quick-links-popular-air-carrier-statistics), includes passenger and flight data from the top three airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines, and is filtered to include the top 10 major domestic airports.
     1. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International
     2. Denver International
     3. Dallas/Fort Worth International
     4. Chicago O’Hare International
     5. Los Angeles International
     6. Harry Reid International
     7. Orlando International
     8. Charlotte Douglas International
     9. Phoenix Sky Harbor International
     10. Seattle/Tacoma International
  - To understand which months to quantify as “busy times'' and “least busiest times” we collected information from a USA Today [article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2017/02/28/busiest-times-of-year-to-fly/98484452/#:~:text=Answer%3A%20There%20are%20several%20times%20a%20year%20when,holiday%20season%2C%20from%20mid-December%20into%20the%20new%20year.), as well as an AFAR [article](https://www.afar.com/magazine/tsa-just-had-its-busiest-week-ever#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20TSA%2C%20the%20busiest%20travel%20days,nearly%202.9%20million%20passengers%20passed%20through%20TSA%20checkpoints.).
  - Understanding this will allow us to further analyze our data and understand different trends within our data. 


## Section 2:
Great (3 points) 
 o [In your README file] Provide instructions about how to access and download your data correctly. 
 o [In your README file] Explain the data types and descriptions of the columns used in visualizations. 
 o [In the Github repo] Upload all data files for your visualization

## Section 3:
 [In your README file] For each visualization, 
 • Great (1 point): Interpret a visualization and explain how it contributes to answering 
your question. 

The first dashboard includes two visualizations that creates a foundation for answering our underlying question: When are the busiest and least busiest times to travel on the top three airlines in the top 10 major domestic airports? “Top 10 Airports in Terms of Number of Flights”, is a visualization map that compares the ten most trafficked domestic airports. The graph is marked with ten circles, with each dot representing one airport, that vary in size corresponding to their ranking in popularity. For example, Atlanta is the most trafficked airport in the country and thus has the biggest plot on the graph. This visualization allows the reader to better picture where the ten most popular airports are on a map and provides a good idea of how popular each airport is. “Flights Per Month by Airport” also tracks the top ten most popular domestic airports, but compares them by total flights in thousands to a given month. This graph goes one step further than the visualization map. By analyzing each airport by month, we can start to determine when the busiest and least busiest time is to travel. Generally, February and September are the least busy months and you should avoid traveling in November. The graphs indicate that the top three airports in the United States are located in Atlanta, Dallas, and Denver.

## Section 4:
Great (3 points) 
 o Find an article related to your questions and summarize the article. 
 o Ask your questions to generative AI. Include generative AI’s response with your query (Ask as many as possible for proper responses; Mention that the response is generated from which generative AI. For example, ChatGPT) 
 o Discuss whether your visualizations align well with the article and generative AI’s response.
