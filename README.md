 - Our question is “When are the busiest and least busiest times to travel on the top three airlines in the top 10 major domestic airports?”
 - This is an important question because it is crucial for customers to understand when it may be more challenging to get a seat on a flight or for different airlines and airports to know when they may need to hire more temporary workers to handle the increased demand for people taking flights.
 - Our data, retrieved from The Bureau of Transportation Statistics, includes passenger and flight data from the top three airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines, and is filtered to include the top 10 major domestic airports.
   - The top 10 major domestic airports:
     1. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International
     2. Denver International
     3. Dallas/Fort Worth International
     4. Chicago O’Hare International
     5. Los Angeles International

Section 1: Revisit your question and its importance and describe the data that you use

Our question is “When are the busiest and least busiest times to travel on the top three airlines in the top 10 major domestic airports?” This is an important question because it is crucial for customers to understand when it may be more challenging to get a seat on a flight or for different airlines and airports to know when they may need to hire more temporary workers to handle the increased demand for people taking flights. Our data, retrieved from The Bureau of Transportation Statistics, includes passenger and flight data from the top three airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines, and is filtered to include the top 10 major domestic airports. 
The top 10 major domestic airports:
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International
Denver International
Dallas/Fort Worth International
Chicago O’Hare International
Los Angeles International
Harry Reid International
Orlando International
Charlotte Douglas International
Phoenix Sky Harbor International
Seattle/Tacoma International
This information was collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Enplanements Per Airport Report.  

To understand which months to quantify as “busy times'' and “least busiest times” we collected information from a USA Today article titled, “Ask Air Traffic Control: Busiest times of year to fly” as well as an AFAR article titled “These Are the Busiest Travel Days of the Year, According to TSA''. Understanding this will allow us to further analyze our data and understand different trends within our data.
